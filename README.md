1) Levels are based on historical data
2) Two standard deviations plus population estimates are used to create initial alert levels
3) Three standard deviations plus population estimates are used to create initial action levels
4) Recommendations are given to address data spikes
5) Recommendations for long term action levels are given.
 



## Introduction

Within any bio-pharmaceutical environment, chemical or microbial water contamination can have a significant negative impact on a manufacturing process, thereby the product, and thereby the consumer. Environmental monitoring is a key tool in the prevention of unwanted contaminants through ensuring the manufacturing process is consistent with acceptable levels per FDA and EU guidelines. By being consistent with these levels, we ensure our products are manufactured in a safe and controlled space such that we can be sure that our products are made free of these contaminants.  

Alert limits are intended as levels that can be used to signal a potential drift from normal operating conditions, such as an increase in microbial endotoxin levels in the manufacturing water system. Reaching an alert limit does not necessarily require suspending an operation, but it is an indication that operators and key personnel should want to begin monitoring the process more closely or begin an investigation. Action limits are intended to signal a definitive drift from normal operating conditions, and as such, indicative that the system is no longer within proper manufacturing control. Reaching an action limit does require suspension of an operation and a formal investigation.

Perform regular trend analysis of environmental monitoring data is crucial ensuring control is maintained in normal operating conditions. Trend analysis helps ensure this by:

1) Identifying any drift from control over time
2) Identifying issues even before alert limits are reached
3) Allows for risk mitigation before the drift affects the products
4) Allows readiness anticipatory of regulatory body audits 

Per FDA and EU guidelines, the environmental monitoring program must be defined, documented, and maintained; and it must detail:

1) Sampling locations
2) Monitoring periodicity
3) Sampling periodicity
4) Sampling duration
5) Sample size (mass, liquid volume, surface area, air volume)
6) Sampling equipment
7) Sampling techniques
8) Alert and action levels
9) Actions taken when specifications are exceeded


## Bioburden and Endotoxin

### Purpose of bioburden and endotoxin testing

Bioburden is defined as the population of viable microorganisms on or in a particular object or medium, formulation, and/or finished product. It is the number of bacteria living in or on a surface or medium that has not been sterilized. It is expressed as CFU/mL (Conlony Forming Units). The purpose of bioburden testing is to:

* determine the total number of viable microorganisms in or on a medical device, container, or component after completion of all in-process steps before      sterilization
* act as an early warning system for possible production issues that could lead to inadequate sterilization and possible product recall
* calculate the necessary dose for effective sterilization against bacteria
* act as an indicator of the overall manufacturing condition

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the target agent in endotoxin testing. It is expressed as EU/mL (Endotoxin Units). LPS is found in the outer cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria (i.e. E. coli). LPS macromolecules range from 10 -20 kDA in molecular weight. The component responsible for the macromolecule's toxic property is the lipid A hydrophobic section found in the cell outer membrane. While LPS serves to protect bacteria from bile salts and lipophilic antibodies; it acts as a pyrogenic agent when introduced to body tissue or blood, causing anything from fever to septic shock.

Outer cell wall components of Gram-negative bacteria are constantly released into the environment upon bacteria cell division or lysis. Because LPS is an extremely stable molecule (thermally resistant, ETO resistant, irradiation resistant) and because it accumulates in heat and chemical resistant biofilms, endotoxin environmental monitoring is pivotal in assuring a safe and controlled medical device and pharmaceutical environment. 

The establishment of a microbial contamination program is critical to getting a new facility qualified and maintained in a state of control once qualified. Water is a primary source of bioburden and endotoxins due to the propensity of biofilm to adhere and accumulate to the surface of pipes. Water flow rates less than 3 ft/sec will not be paticualarly susceptible to biofilm amalgamation. Environmental monitoring can pass endotoxin screening but still fail bioburden screening as well as vice versa; therefore it is important to perform both tests in microbial screening. 


### Legal basis of bioburden and endotoxin testing

The legal basis for Bioburden testing lies within CFR 21 (Code of Federal Register 21) and ISO 11737 worldwide. 21 C.F.R. 211.110 (a)(6) states that bioburden in-process testing must be conducted pursuant to written procedures during the manufacturing process of drug products. Current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements specified in 21 CFR Part 211.113, *Control of Microbiological Contamination*, states "Appropriate written procedures, designed to prevent objectionable microorganisms in drug products not required to be sterile, shall be established and followed." The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) provides several tests that can be performed to quantify the Bioburden of non-sterile drug products.

Water is a frequent source of both endotoxins and bioburden, which carry Gram negative bacteria. There is no required or established industry method for setting water levels such as bioburden environmental levels, however, use of standard deviations to set levels is the most common approach due to simplicity. A misleading argument often used against using standard deviations is that microbial data does not fit a normal distribution. However, standard deviation is a good indicator of the dispersion of data, regardless of whether or not the data is normally distributed. 

The Federal Register, January 18, 1980, proposed guidelines for determining endotoxins with the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Test (LAL). Subsequently, the draft guideline was revised and reissued in 1983. The USP XX, 5th supplement, revised the Bacterial Endotoxins Test. However, unlike the FDA draft guideline, no retest provisions were included. Pharmaceutical grade purified water have an allowable endotoxin limit of 0.25 EU/mL. However, Bacteriostatic Water for Injection and Sterile Water for Inhalation have been given a slightly higher bacterial endotoxin limit of 0.5 EU/ml (USP - Supplement 4a - 1984). 


## TOC and Conductivity

Total organic carbon (TOC) is an important parameter in purified water. It is expressed in parts per billion Carbon (ppbC). TOC quantifies the presence of organic carbon and is used as an indicator of water quality and cleanliness of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities and equipment. Water conductivity is another measure of the purity of water, but regarding ion contaminants. It is expressed in microsiemens per centimeter (µS/cm). Water molecules dissociate into ions as a function of pH and temperature, which results in very predictable conductivity. Pure distilled and deionized water, for instance, has a conductivity of 0.05 µS/cm. Many gases (i.e.carbon dioxide) readily dissolve in water and interact to form ions, and because of this their resulting conductivity is considered intrinsic to water. But water is also affected by extraneous ions (i.e. chloride, ammonium), therefore water conductivity is a crucial part of environmental monitoring to ensure water quality does not negatively impact pharmaceutical processes, thereby products, and thereby consumers.     

### Statistical considerations for analysis

When evaluating historical data, it is always appropriate to consider whether it is important that the data fit a standard statistical model (i.e. normal distribution). For in-process spec limit determination, whether or not the data fits a standard classical model is less important than whether the alert and action levels are based on real empirical data. One reason why data may not fit a normal distribution is due to spikes. It is typical for most of bioburden data, for example, to be near the mean with occasional spikes, particularly in the medical device industry.

Another consideration is what to do with missing data. When managing missing data, it is important to first have some knowledge of how the data was captured. Techniques like mean or regression imputation are predicated on assumptions on the data, therefore Identifying the type of missingness present is crucial in choosing the appropriate technique to manage it. Reasons for missing data can range from being a function of observed data (MAR) to event factors not captured in the data (MNAR). Without a predicate knowledge of the data capturing process, it is difficult to identify a root cause for the missing data and thereby the appropriate statistical response. When large amounts of data occur repeatedly missing across multiple attributes, it is a good practice to assume the data as MCAR or missing independent of the observed and unobserved data (i.e. who submitted the data or an error in the entire data capturing process). In many cases, missing data can be substituted with column means or regression-extrapolated values, but when attempting to set alert and action levels, it is best for the levels to be informed by the empirical data; and that often requires omitting data where there is no observation.

Another consideration is whether there is too little data. When there is not enough environmental monitoring data to establish long-term levels, initial/temporary levels can be used to establish a baseline to create temporary alert and action levels. When sufficient historical data exists, long term levels can be established. At this point, a plan of action for setting the long term alert and action levels should be documented, and it should cover the transition from temporary to long term levels as well as frequency of re-evaluation. Lastly, it is not desirable to set alert levels so low that they are triggered often.

When setting alert / action levels, it is not desirable that the alert / action levels be triggered often, which would be indicative of either too much variability in the results or that the alert level is too low. It is best to use estimates to establish values rather than averages or maximum values. In this simplistic approach, estimates are taken from the mean and standard error, and two and three standard deviations applied to them to approximate 95 and 97% of the population.

### Methods

Assuming sampling methodology being already defined and maintained, and assuming historical data representing normal operating conditions, a trend analysis was performed from the historical data in an attempt to prescribe appropriate alert and action levels for bioburden, endotoxin, TOC, and conductivity environmental monitoring. 

Missing data was presumed MCAR with no multicolinearity across attributes (sampling sites). Sampling dates with greater than 40% missing data were omitted from analysis, which accounted for roughly 17% of the original data. Imputation was not conducted on the missing data in order to ensure only empirical data observed, not inferred, projected, or extrapolated, was used to create alert and action levels.     

Univariate analysis was performed on each set. A Shapiro_Wilk statistical test was used to evaluate the normality in observations. Alert levels were set to 2 standard deviations above historical estimates. Action levels were set to 3 standard deviations above historical estimates. This corresponds to the 95 percentile and 97 percentile approach used in data that fits a normal distribution. Standard deviation is deemed appropriate as it is still a useful measure of the dispersion of the data. It results in tight alert and action levels that are  not too restrictive but can still signal any drift from normal operating conditions. Because of the limit in historical data, the levels prescribed were initial/ temporary levels to serve as a baseline until the availability of more historical data.
